# Document Summarizer with Groq LLM

This project is a Streamlit web app that allows you to upload documents and generate multi-level summaries using the Groq Llama 3.1 model.

## Features

* Upload PDF, Word (DOCX), Text (TXT), or CSV documents via a simple web interface.
* Automatically extract text from uploaded files — including OCR for scanned PDFs.
* Generate multi-level summaries by choosing the level in the app:
   * Brief: 1–2 sentence summary
   * Standard: concise summary
   * Detailed: full summary with all key points
* Dockerized for easy deployment.
* Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests.

## Requirements

* Docker installed on your system.
* A Groq API key — sign up at https://groq.com to obtain it.
* `.env` file with your API key.

Example `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

```

⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub.

## How to Run

1. Stop any running container
If a previous container is still running, stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or:

```
docker ps
docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>

```

2. Build the Docker image
From the project root:

```
docker build -t summarizer-app .

```

3. Run the container

```
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env summarizer-app

```

This will start the Streamlit app on http://localhost:8501.
Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid Groq API key.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Upload a PDF, DOCX, TXT, or CSV file.
3. Choose the summary level by selecting one of the options in the app:
   * Brief: 1–2 sentence summary
   * Standard: concise summary
   * Detailed: full summary with all key points
4. Click Submit to generate the summary.
5. The summary will be displayed below the file uploader, labeled according to the chosen level.

```

## Continuous Integration (CI)

* GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs unit tests in `tests/` on every push or pull request.
* OCR and file extraction tests run even if the Groq API key is not set.
* LLM summarization tests are skipped if `GROQ_API_KEY` is missing, preventing CI failures.
